# IP address tracker

You can:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See your own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

Technologies utilized in development:

- React JS 18;
- Typescript;
- SASS;
- React Query v3 (Tanstack Query);

 To get the IP Address locations I've used
 [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).
 To generate the map: [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
